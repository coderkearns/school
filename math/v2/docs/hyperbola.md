## Hyperbola

A hyperbola is the set of all points in a plane equidistant from the foci. Each branch of the hyperbola contains a vertex point, and the curve wraps around a focus point within boundaries known as asymptotes. Both the vertex points and the foci lie on an axis of symmetry which contains a segment between the vertex points known as the transverse axis. There is another axis of symmetry perpendicular to the transverse axis that contains a segment referred to as the conjugate axis. The center of the hyperbola is the intersection point of these two axes.

### Equation of a Hyperbola

With a horizontal transverse axis:
```
(x - h)^2   (y - k)^2
————————— - ————————— = 1
   a^2         b^2
```

With a vertical transverse axis:
```
(y - k)^2   (x - h)^2
————————— - ————————— = 1
   a^2         b^2
```
c^2 = a^2 + b^2

### Properties of Hyperbolas

|   | Horizontal | Vertical |
| - | ---------- | -------- |
| Equation | `( (x - h)^2 / a^2 ) - ( (y - k)^2 / b^2 ) = 1` | `( (y - k)^2 / a^2 ) - ( (x - h)^2 / b^2 ) = 1 ` |
| Center | `(h, k)` | `(h, k)` |
| Foci | `(h - c, k)` and `(h + c, k)` | `(h, k - c)` and `(h, k + c)` |
| Vertices | `(h - a, k)` and `(h + a, k)` | `(h, k - a)` and `(h, k + a)` |
| Slopes of Asymptotes | `b / a` and `-b / a` | `a / b` and `-a / b`
