## Point(x, y)

### Each of the following are both a classmethod and instancemethod
distance = √( (x1 - x2)^2 + (y1-y2)^2 )
midpoint = ( (x1+x2)/2 , (y1+y2)/2 )

## Line(p1, p2)

## Circle:

(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2

Where center = Point(h, k)

## Ellipse
The set of all points in a plane where the sum of the distances from two special points, called focus points, is equal.

Every ellipse has two axes of symmetry. The parts of the axes of symmetry which lie inside the ellipse are called the major and minor axes.

### Special Points
The focus points, or foci, lie on the major axis.
Consequently, the major axis is a longer segment whose distance is `2a`, whereas the minor axis is the shorter segment whose distance is `2b(a > b)`.
The distance between the foci is `2c`.
There is a special relationship between `a`, `b` and `c` in an ellipse. self relationship, involving the Pythagorean theorem, is `b^2 = a^2 - c^2`

### Equation
The equation of an ellipse with a horizontal major axis and center `(h, k)` is:
```
(x - h)^2    (y - k)^2
—————————— + —————————— = 1
   a^2          b^2

```

The equation of an ellipse with a vertical major axis and center `(h, k)` is:
```
(x - h)^2    (y - k)^2
—————————— + —————————— = 1
   b^2          a^2

where b^2 = a^2 - c^2
```

### How to tell it's type
If `b > a`: This is a `vertical` ellipse.

If `a > v`: This is a `horizontal` ellipse.
